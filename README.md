The parallel function calculates the effective resitance of parallel resistors by using circuit theory. The function takes a list as an argument and a total sum of all the resistors in the list. The function returns an inverse of the sum as the a representation of the effective resistance.

The potential divider function calculates the effective resitance of series resistors by using circuit theory. The function takes a list and the value of the volatge supplye as an argument. It also calculates total sum of all the resistors in the list. The function uses the sum of all the resistors to find the constant current flowing through every resistor. With this information, the fucntion returns the voltage drop of each resistor.

The temp check function surveys the patients temperature in either Fahrenheit or Degrees Celsius, however, the temp value if Fahrenheit is changed to degrees Celsius where it is further evaluated whether the patient temp is: normal, hypothermic or hyperthermic.

Because they make everything up
